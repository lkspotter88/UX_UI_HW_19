                <h1>Hello, I am Linda Potter</h1>
                <p>As a UX researcher, I enjoy solving user problems through seeking to
                      understand user backgrounds and motivations and developing solutions
                       that more effectively connect users to the technology upon which they depend.</p>

            <h1>Linda's Story</h1>
            <p>From childhood, Linda was fascinated with technology.  
                She studied computer science in both high school and college and enjoyed 
                a 3-year career as a software developer at AT&T.  She enjoyed the challenge of 
                solving problems with code and designing tools to benefit the development team.
            </p>
            <img src="images/binary-2450188_1920.png" alt="laptop surrounded by binary codes">
            <p>When a family member started an independent medical practice, Linda turned her 
                problem-solving skills from code to people.  Interacting with people from diverse 
                backgrounds, she learned to present technical medical information in a way suited 
                to the person with whom she was interacting.  She also learned to ask probing, but 
                not leading, questions to gain an understanding of patient problems and communicate 
                this information to the medical providers.  The best outcomes were achieved when 
                the root of the problem could be identified and treated rather than just treating visible symptoms.
            </p>

            <p>Now, Linda brings these skill sets to uncover user pain points and work 
                with designers to create solutions that will provide users of 
                technology with both a successful and stress-free experience.
